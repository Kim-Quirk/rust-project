# Overview

In order to learn the Rust language, I decided to create a rather basic calculator. The calculator takes in a user-determined amount of inputs and then provides a user-determined operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on all values.

I decided to complete this project in order to learn Rust. I have never done anything with Rust before. I hoped this project could teach me more about fucntions, variables, vectors, and more.

# Development Environment

Tools: Visual Studio Code

Languages: Rust

# Useful Websites

* [Rust Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)
* [Tutorial Point - Rust](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/index.htm)

# Future Work

* Let the user decide each operation between each value.
* Do not display the option for division if it will cause a divide by zero error.
* Create a limit to the vector size to help prevent floating-point rounding error.
* Look at ways to address floating-point rounding errors.
* Fix bug where user inputs wrong data and the calculator asks for correct information too many times.
